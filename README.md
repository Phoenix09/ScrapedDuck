# ScrapedDuck

ScrapedDuck routinely scrapes [LeekDuck.com](https://leekduck.com) (with permission) for Pokemon GO data and pushes said data to [a branch](https://github.com/bigfoott/ScrapedDuck/tree/data) on this repository for use by other external applications. If you plan to use this in your Pokemon GO related projects, please follow [the guidelines below](#for-developers).

To follow development progress for this tool, check out [the Trello board for PoGOEvents/ScrapedDuck](https://trello.com/b/32UjZbdu/pogoevents-scrapedduck).

## For Developers

Developers, feel free to use this data for whatever project's you like! As long as your use of this data follows the terms below, you should be good!

- Applications of the APIs cannot be hidden behind a paywall.
- Applications of the APIs cannot be monetized with advertisements.
- Give credit to ScrapedDuck and [LeekDuck.com](https://leekduck.com).

I just want to emphasize again to credit **[LeekDuck.com](https://leekduck.com)**, as the data itself is provided by them.
